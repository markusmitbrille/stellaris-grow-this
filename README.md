Changes some defines to rebalance population growth. Base growth is now 1, which can change between 0.5 and up to 50 via logistic growth. Growth on planets below half capacity are now also scaled down, making new colonies only desirable in conjunction with migration (as it should be). Increased maximum growth from immigration to 100.
